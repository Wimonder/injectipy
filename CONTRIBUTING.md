Thank you for your interest in contributing to Injectipy! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/injectipy.git
   cd injectipy
   ```

3. **Set up the development environment**:
   ```bash
   # Install Poetry (if not already installed)
   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

   # Install dependencies
   poetry install

   # Install pre-commit hooks
   poetry run pre-commit install
   ```

4. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. **Make your changes** and commit them
6. **Push to your fork** and create a pull request

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management
- Git

### Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Wimonder/injectipy.git
cd injectipy

# Install Poetry dependencies
poetry install

# Activate the virtual environment
poetry shell

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

### Development Tools

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

- **Poetry**: Dependency management and packaging
- **Black**: Code formatting
- **Ruff**: Fast Python linting
- **MyPy**: Static type checking
- **pytest**: Testing framework
- **Pre-commit**: Git hooks for code quality

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
poetry run pytest

# Run with coverage
poetry run pytest --cov=injectipy --cov-report=html

# Run specific test files by functionality
poetry run pytest tests/test_core_inject.py            # Basic @inject decorator tests
poetry run pytest tests/test_scope_functionality.py   # DependencyScope tests
poetry run pytest tests/test_error_handling.py        # Error handling tests
poetry run pytest tests/test_parameter_types.py       # Parameter type support tests
poetry run pytest tests/test_decorator_compatibility.py # Decorator interaction tests
poetry run pytest tests/test_thread_safety.py         # Thread safety tests
poetry run pytest tests/test_performance.py           # Performance benchmarks
poetry run pytest tests/test_python_features.py       # Advanced Python feature tests
```

### Test Categories

We organize tests using pytest markers:

- `performance`: Performance and stress tests
- `edge_case`: Edge cases and error condition tests
- `slow`: Tests that take longer to run
- `integration`: Integration tests

### Test Organization

Tests are organized by functionality in separate files:

- `test_core_inject.py`: Basic @inject decorator functionality
- `test_scope_functionality.py`: DependencyScope registration and resolution
- `test_error_handling.py`: Error cases and exception handling
- `test_parameter_types.py`: Different parameter type support (regular, keyword-only, positional-only)
- `test_decorator_compatibility.py`: Interaction with other Python decorators
- `test_thread_safety.py`: Thread safety and concurrent access tests
- `test_performance.py`: Performance benchmarks and stress tests
- `test_python_features.py`: Advanced Python feature compatibility

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in the appropriate test file based on functionality
- Use descriptive test names: `test_should_inject_dependency_when_registered`
- Follow the AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert
- Use appropriate pytest markers
- Import specific exceptions for error testing: `DependencyNotFoundError`, `CircularDependencyError`, etc.

Example test:

```python
import pytest
from injectipy import DependencyScope, Inject, inject, DependencyNotFoundError

@pytest.fixture
def scope():
    return DependencyScope()

def test_should_inject_registered_value(scope):
    # Arrange
    scope.register_value("test_key", "test_value")

    @inject
    def test_function(value: str = Inject["test_key"]):
        return value

    # Act & Assert
    with scope:
        result = test_function()
        assert result == "test_value"

def test_should_raise_exception_for_missing_dependency(scope):
    # Arrange
    @inject
    def test_function(value: str = Inject["missing_key"]):
        return value

    # Act & Assert
    with scope:
        with pytest.raises(DependencyNotFoundError, match="Dependency 'missing_key' not found"):
            test_function()
```

## üé® Code Style

### Formatting and Linting

We enforce consistent code style using automated tools:

```bash
# Format code
poetry run black .

# Lint code
poetry run ruff check .

# Type checking
poetry run mypy injectipy/


# Run all quality checks
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Style Guidelines

- Follow PEP 8 and PEP 484 (type hints)
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Write docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use type hints consistently
- Prefer explicit over implicit

### Docstring Format

Use Google-style docstrings:

```python
def register_value(self, key: str | type, value: object) -> DependencyScope:
    """Register a concrete value in the dependency scope.

    Args:
        key: The key to register the value under
        value: The value to register

    Returns:
        Self for method chaining

    Raises:
        DuplicateRegistrationError: If the key is already registered

    Example:
        >>> scope = DependencyScope()
        >>> scope.register_value("config", {"debug": True})
    """
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

- **DependencyScope**: Context-managed dependency registry
- **@inject decorator**: Function/method injection decorator
- **Inject[key]**: Dependency marker for injection
- **Thread Safety**: All operations are thread-safe

### Design Principles

- **Simplicity**: Keep the API minimal and intuitive
- **Performance**: Optimize for common use cases
- **Thread Safety**: All operations must be thread-safe
- **Type Safety**: Full type hint support
- **Testability**: Design for easy testing
